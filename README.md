# Portfolio and Resume of Joshua Faith

This HTML code and CSS style sheet make up a website of my personal Portfolio, able 
to show off my resume, contact information and Projects/designs that I have worked on myself,
in order for different employers and companies to see my skills and which jobs I am best 
suited for in my career.

## User Story

AS AN active looking employee
I WANT deploy work samples of projects and designs I have worked on myself
SO THAT employers and recruiters can review my samples and assess whether or not I am a good
candidate for the position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Review
The active website is now deploying work samples of my own work, being able to update as I continue to create 
and design new projects, then uploading so companies and employers can see my samples progressively. It also includes
my contact information, LinkedIn account and GitHub, places for the employers to reach out to me and see if I am 
the best candidate for the position.
